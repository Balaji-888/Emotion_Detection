# Emotion_Detection
This project is a deep learning-powered emotion detection system that analyzes facial expressions from images and accurately classifies them into predefined emotional categories. Designed with a user-friendly interface using Tkinter, it allows users to upload images and instantly see the predicted emotion label.


## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔍 Detects emotions from facial expressions in images.
- 📷 Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade for face detection.
- 🧠 Predicts one of 7 emotions: "Angry", "Disgust", "Fear", "Happy", "Neutral", "Sad", "Surprise".
- 💡 Easy-to-use Python GUI application using Tkinter.
- ✅ Offline execution – no need for internet after setup.
